# bcdCounter
A BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) counter is a type of electronic counter circuit used in digital electronics. In BCD counting, each decimal digit is represented by its 4-bit binary equivalent. This means that in a BCD counter, the count is represented in binary form, where each digit of the count is encoded using four binary bits.
